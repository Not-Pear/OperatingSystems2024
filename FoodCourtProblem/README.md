This project attempted to solve the foodcourt problem. There is a foodcourt with a limited capacity. Inside there are three options; Burgers, Pizza, and Wings. Each option had its own queue. 
The customer at the front of the queue would spend a random amount of time deciding what they would want to purchase, then move to order. From there, they would move to a second queue for the cashiers
which had its own queue. From there, the customer would pay, eat their food, then leave. This project's purpose was to practice the use of threads in a large quantity, queues, semaphors, and multiplexers (MUXs)
