This program attempted to tackle the issue of the single bridge problem. There is a single bridge that has two directions: North and South. There is a random amount of different vehicles that all take different times to cross the bridge.
At a single time, only one vehicle can cross the bridge. There are also emergency vehicles that take priority in all queues. 
The goal was to keep the queue at a reasonable size, have all vehicles cross the bridge one at a time, and have emergency vehicles take priority in the queue. 
This project's intended goal was to practice the use of threads, semaphores, and multiplexers (MUXs)
